# WordPress WP Statistics authenticated xss Vulnerability(WP Statistics <=12.0.9)


# Description #

Version 12.0.9 and below of the WP Statistics WordPress Plugin was found to be vulnerable to Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).The `'rangestart'` and `'rangeend'` GET parameter on page wps_referrers_page is output without validated, sanitised or output encoded. This leads to Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which could allow attackers to compromise a WordPress application by tricking an authenticated administrator user into clicking on a specially crafted link.

# Technical Description: #

file `/includes/log/top-referring.php` line 86, the `date_args` variable is output in the PHP `echo()` function
